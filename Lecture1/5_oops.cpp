Abstraction
    - Delivering only essential details to ouside world while masking the ackground details.
    - It is a design and programming method that seperates interface from implementation
    - Let's take sort function sort(vector.being(), vctor.end()) or it also take sort(string.begin(), string.end())
        so inspite of anything given we doesn't care about internal functioning and thinks of output (sorted elements)

    - Abstract does is creates interface and on that interface and once you write the code in interface, it
